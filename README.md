# OpenWeather app

## Setup



In order to start the program, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). When you have downloaded Node.js, you must install Axios, this is done by running "npm install axios" when you are in the "./weatherapp" folder.

Then to start the program, run "npm run dev" in the "weatherapp" folder(same folder as before).

Also insert your own api key (https://openweathermap.org/) in "app.jsx" ar row 11.
