# OpenWeather app

## Setup



In order to start the program, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). When you have downloaded Node.js, you must install Axios, this is done by running (in the terminal) "npm install axios" when you are in the "./weatherapp" folder.

Then to start the program, run "npm run dev" in the "weatherapp" folder(same folder as before).
The program will start running at localhost port 8000.

Also insert your own api key (https://openweathermap.org/) in "app.jsx" at row 11.

## Info
Program done with Vite.js and React.js
